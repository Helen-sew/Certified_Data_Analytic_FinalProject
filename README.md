This report provides an analysis of customer spending habits and identifies important customer
groups using RFM analysis. The report also predicts the lifetime value of each customer and
identifies key factors that influence it through a regression model. The analysis further explores
the important features of the best model and examines the demographics of the customers
based on those features. While the report provides a brief product analysis by product name,
further research is needed to better understand the specific product preferences of each
customer cluster.
